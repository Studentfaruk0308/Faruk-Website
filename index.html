   I have shown my academic talent by being awarded with student scholarship starting from as early as Primary School till completion of formal training as Pre-Sea Cadet.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Upon completion of formal study, I started my career as a Merchant Marine Officer in commercial vessel and gained extensive sailing experience at sea on worldwide voyages.
</p> 

<p align="center">
    After reaching at the peak of my sea career as a Master Mariner I decided to explore ashore and joined as Marine Superintendent with a Ship Owning Company where I have gained valuable experience in managing number of commercial vessels under my responsibility. After serving in preceding post I have joined in an internationally renowned inspection and testing company where I am exploring almost all the fields of maritime industry as an Independent Marine Surveyor as well as Branch Manager. After working in different sectors of Maritime Industry I have gained remarkable experience that will help me to perform the duty of any Managerial Post as well as back up Surveyor. I have gained experience in the Maritime Industry from many different perspectives i.e. Seafarer, Ship Owner/Operator, Charterer, Shipper, Insurance, Port, Terminal, PSC, FSC etc. either as an employee or while representing and working with them in various situations. I have been also managing and coordinating inspections and stevedoring either by company's own employee or by the subcontractors. This will give me an additional advantage if I am given additional responsibility as I have a complete overview of the industry.
</p> 
<p align="center">
<b>My strengths are my total dedication to the assigned responsibility, reach the goal by good team work and complete the task with outmost precision. I am confident that I will be able to carry out the job function smoothly with my practical experience and institutional knowledge that I have gained so far.</b>
</p>

    <b>
        I have a great affinity to computer programming. I used to spend a lot of time adding formula in Excel Sheet to carry out complex calculation on board the vessel. I am currently attending Software Engineering Course with ACADEMY Xi.
